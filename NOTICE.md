# Notice and Public Use Guidance

Last updated: 2026-02-28

This repository is an evidence-based interoperability package derived from publicly observable AI Collective web assets and copy on the snapshot date above. It is provided for tooling alignment and on-brand generation workflows.

## Trademark and Brand Rights

- "The AI Collective", associated names, and logo marks may be protected by trademark and related rights owned by their respective holders.
- This repository is not an official AI Collective publication unless explicitly stated by AI Collective.
- Inclusion of URLs, marks, and descriptive guidance here does not grant trademark rights, endorsement, or a commercial license.

## Attribution and Scope

- Source evidence is documented in `evidence/source-map.md`.
- Unknown or inferred values are explicitly labeled in this package.
- This package should not be treated as a substitute for direct written brand permission or a private brand handbook.

## Public Repo Usage Expectations

- Verify legal permission for logo and trademark use before commercial deployment.
- Re-validate live source parity before major campaigns, because public web assets can change over time.
- If official brand documentation becomes available, official guidance takes precedence over this repository.

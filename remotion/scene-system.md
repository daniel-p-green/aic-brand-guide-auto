# AI Collective Remotion Scene System

Version: 1.0.0  
Token dependency: `tokens/brand-tokens.json`

## Scene Grammar
Use this grammar for modular video assembly:
- `S0 Hook`: quick signal of mission + human-centered framing.
- `S1 Context`: establish domain, chapter, or event relevance.
- `S2 Proof`: show people, outcomes, or community credibility.
- `S3 Invitation`: direct CTA toward joining, attending, or collaborating.

## Canonical 30s Timing Blueprint
- S0 Hook: 0s-4s
- S1 Context: 4s-12s
- S2 Proof: 12s-24s
- S3 Invitation: 24s-30s

## Archetypes

### Archetype A: Community Teaser
- S0: Mission statement over high-energy event footage.
- S1: Global chapter presence and people-first copy.
- S2: Testimonials, event moments, or partner logos.
- S3: CTA (`Join The Collective`, `Find An Event`).

### Archetype B: Partner Spotlight
- S0: Partner + AI Collective framing.
- S1: Why collaboration matters.
- S2: Outcome montage (forums, demos, stakeholder exchange).
- S3: CTA (`Partner With Us`).

### Archetype C: Chapter Launch
- S0: City/chapter identifier + mission.
- S1: Local relevance and community role.
- S2: Event clips or leader highlights.
- S3: CTA (`Start a Chapter` / `Join a Local Team`).

## Typography and Layout Rules
- Heading style: serif-led, concise, high contrast.
- Supporting text: sans, shorter line lengths.
- Keep critical text within configured safe zone.
- Avoid dense multiline overlays over high-motion footage.

## Transition Rules
- Preferred: soft fades, gentle slide-ins, restrained scale.
- Avoid abrupt whip transitions unless used sparingly in hook.
- Keep transitions short enough to protect message time budget.

## Caption Treatments
- Use clean sans captions with background support when needed.
- Prioritize semantic beats over verbatim filler.
- Keep caption blocks concise and center-stable for readability.

## Audio Direction
- Clean, modern, minimal bed.
- Voiceover should be clear and foregrounded.
- Use energy lift near CTA without masking final message.

## Safe Zone Defaults
- Top: 8%
- Bottom: 12%
- Sides: 6%

## Failure Modes and Mitigations
- If text becomes unreadable: increase overlay opacity and reduce background motion.
- If pacing feels rushed: remove one intermediate beat, preserve hook+proof+CTA.
- If output feels off-brand: re-check token compliance, then voice checklist.
